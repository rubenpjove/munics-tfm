## Description
This project focuses on Operating System fingerprinting using [Tabular Transformers](https://github.com/lucidrains/tab-transformer-pytorch) with different datasets. The aim is to explore the application of advanced deep learning architectures in the field of network security. The repositoy is structured in different folders, according to the experiments executed on the three different datasets used.


## Installation
The project was developed using Python 3.10.8. To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command. 

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets
